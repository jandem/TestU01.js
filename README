TestU01 compiled to asm.js with Emscripten.

testu01.test.js was compiled as follows, if I remember correctly:

* Install Emscripten
* Download TestU01 from http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html
* Extract TestU01
* emconfigure ./configure
* emmake ./make
* emcc -O3 test.c testu01/.libs/libtestu01.a mylib/.libs/libmylib.a probdist/.libs/libprobdist.a -o testu01.test.js -I /usr/local/include/ -s TOTAL_MEMORY=536870912

I got some compilation failures in some ancient-looking C file(s). It was trivial to fix them, though.
